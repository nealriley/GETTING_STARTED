There's an assumption worth naming: terminals are for writing code, code is for programmers, therefore terminals aren't for me.

**This assumption is wrong. Completely wrong.**

Terminals - and the AI tools that use them - are interfaces to creation. Not just code. Everything a computer can produce.

## Documents

Reports. Proposals. Formatted PDFs. Documentation with tables of contents and proper headings. AI tools with file access can take your messy notes, structure them, format them, and output a polished document.

## Images

Generated graphics. Processed photographs. Diagrams and flowcharts. Resized, cropped, watermarked, compressed - whatever the task requires.

## Visualizations

Charts. Graphs. Dashboards. You have a spreadsheet. You want to see trends. AI tools can read your data, choose appropriate visualizations, and generate them.

## Audio

Transcriptions from recordings. Cleaned-up podcast audio. Generated speech from text. AI tools can process sound - transcribe it, manipulate it, convert formats, combine clips.

## Scripts That Take Actions

A script that renames 500 files according to a pattern. A script that downloads all images from a webpage. A script that backs up specific folders every night.

This is code, yes. But it's not building an application. It's making your computer do work *for you* - automating the tedious, repeating the repetitive.

## The Reframe

**Terminals aren't coding tools. They're creation tools with a text interface.**

The question isn't "can I code?" The question is "what do I want to create?"

The tools don't care whether you're a developer. They just execute.
