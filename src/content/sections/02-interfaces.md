Picture this: You're using Claude. Maybe through the website chat. Maybe through Claude Code in your terminal. Maybe through the new Cowork app that just launched. Maybe embedded in your Slack workspace, or inside Excel, or as a Chrome extension.

**Same model. Drastically different experiences.**

The interface shapes everything - what you can do, how you do it, what feels natural, what feels impossible.

## The Landscape

**Web Chat Interfaces** (claude.ai, chatgpt.com)
- Where most people start
- Great for conversation, brainstorming, quick questions
- Limited: can't directly manipulate files, run commands, or access your system

**CLI Tools** (Claude Code, OpenAI's tools)
- Command-line interfaces that can read/write files, execute code, search your projects
- Powerful but intimidating - requires terminal comfort
- Built for developers, but increasingly used by non-coders for complex file tasks

**Desktop Apps** (Claude Cowork, Cursor, Windsurf)
- Middle ground: GUI interfaces with system access
- Designate a folder, chat about its contents, let it modify files
- No terminal required, but all the power of file manipulation

## Why This Matters

When someone says "I tried Claude and it couldn't help with X," the question is: *which* Claude? The web chat can't search through folders. Claude Code can. Cowork can, but without the terminal.

The underlying intelligence is the same, but the interface determines what's possible.

**The models are smart enough now that the bottleneck isn't intelligence - it's access.**
