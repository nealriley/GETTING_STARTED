Here's what most people send to AI:

> I need help with our Q3 report. Sales were up but costs increased too. Marketing did that campaign in August. We should probably mention the new product launch. Oh and the team grew by 3 people...

And here's what they get back: a generic response, followed by ten clarifying questions, followed by something that misses the mark entirely.

Now watch what happens when the same information gets organized:

```
## Audience
CEO, board members

## Key Metrics
| Metric | Q3 2025 | Q3 2024 | Change |
| Revenue | $2.4M | $2.3M | +4.3% |
| Costs | $1.95M | $1.8M | +8.3% |

## Notable Events
- August marketing campaign (+12% leads)
- New product launch (September)
- Team expansion (+3 engineers)
```

**The information was roughly the same. What changed was how it was organized.**

## Format as Forcing Function

When you choose a format, you choose how to think:
- **Tables** force comparison
- **Numbered steps** force sequence
- **Checklists** force completeness
- **Headers** force hierarchy

## The Gift of Empty Cells

The most valuable moment in structuring is when you can't fill something in. Those question marks are valuable - they show exactly what you need to find out.

**Structure is a diagnostic tool.** It shows you what you don't know.

The clearer your structure, the better your results.
