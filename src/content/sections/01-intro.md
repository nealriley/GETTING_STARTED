AI-powered tools have exposed the practice of software development to people who would otherwise be unable to write code. "Vibe coders" are building apps, automating workflows, and creating tools—all without traditional programming training. 

They are also writing scripts, and **Terminals love scripts**.

You don't need to become a professional developer in order to use some of the tools of the trade. But the more you understand about how these tools like Terminals work, the more powerful these tools become. This includes using AI tools to do the 'writing' of software and scripts.

The gap between "frustrating black box" and "genuine superpower" is smaller than you think.
