Now look at the same action - listing files - but without the AI in the middle.

Instead of typing "List the files in this folder," you type `ls`.

That's it. Same request. Same result. Different syntax.

## The Language Barrier

The intimidation comes from the *language*, not the interaction model.

Terminal commands are terse. They're abbreviations that made sense when keyboards were slow and screens were small:

- `ls` = "list"
- `cd` = "change directory"
- `cp` = "copy"
- `mv` = "move"
- `rm` = "remove"

It's a foreign language. But the conversation structure is identical.

## Text In, Text Out

Whether you're talking to Claude or talking directly to your computer:

1. You type text
2. You press enter
3. You get text back

The pattern is the same. The only difference is the vocabulary.

**And you don't need to learn that vocabulary anymore.**
