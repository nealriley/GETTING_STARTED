It wasn't immediately obvious that files would become one of the most powerful ways to work with AI. Early on, everything was chat-based - ephemeral conversations that disappeared when you closed the window.

But the community discovered something important:

**The output of your work with AI should often be a file on disk.**

## Why Files Matter

- **Persistent context** - Unlike chat history that disappears, files stay accessible
- **Portable instructions** - Move them between tools, share with colleagues, version control with git
- **Accumulating knowledge** - Build up a library of working patterns and guidelines

Chat is ephemeral. Files are permanent. That permanence changes everything.

## Description Becomes Reality

This is the closest thing to magic in practical computing: **you describe something in structured text, and it becomes real.**

You can describe:
- **Prompts** - Specific task requests you want to reuse
- **Skills** - Teaching the AI HOW to do something
- **Agents** - Shaping WHO the AI is for this context

## Why Markdown Specifically?

Markdown hits a sweet spot:
- **Human-friendly** - Reads like normal text
- **Machine-friendly** - AI parses structure reliably
- **Workflow-friendly** - Version control, works everywhere

You didn't install anything. You didn't configure anything. You described what you wanted, and it became real.

**Markdown is the lingua franca for AI collaboration.**
