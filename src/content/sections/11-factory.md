Every codebase has a story. Not just in its code, but in its documentation - the READMEs, the comments, the getting-started guides, the troubleshooting pages.

This accumulated writing was always valuable. But it was passive. A record. A reference. Something a human might read when they got stuck.

**Now it's something more.**

## Documentation Works

When you give an AI tool access to documentation - a getting-started guide, an API reference, a project README - something interesting happens. The AI doesn't just *read* the documentation. It *uses* it.

The patterns in the code examples become patterns it can follow. The troubleshooting steps become diagnostic procedures it can apply.

**Documentation has become productive. It does work.**

## The Accumulated Walls

Think about what exists in any mature project:
- Onboarding guides that encode how things should be done
- Style guides that encode preferences and standards
- Decision logs that encode institutional reasoning
- FAQs that encode common problems and solutions

This is the "factory walls" - the accumulated wisdom built up over time, written down, maintained, refined.

For decades, this knowledge sat in documents that humans had to find, read, and internalize. Now AI can read them, internalize them, and *act on them* in seconds.

## The Gap Has Narrowed

You now understand: interfaces shape what's possible. Terminals are conversations. Package managers are app stores. Computers create more than code. Markdown files are executable specifications. Structure clarifies thinking. Context has types. Decoration signals meaning.

And documentation - yours, theirs, everyone's - now does work.

**Press the right buttons. Build something.**
