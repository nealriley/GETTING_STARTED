AI tools love a Terminal! After using these tools for a bit you may find you love using it too. 

Your files, your projects, your tools—they live on your computer. The terminal is how you access them directly. It's the native interface to your machine.

For those who know how to speak its language, Terminals can be very quick, flexible, and powerful. They can do really complex tasks. They can do a lot of small tasks really fast. 

*It's all about using the right tool for the right job.*
