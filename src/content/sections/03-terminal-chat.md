You already know how to use a terminal. You just don't know it yet.

Think about how you interact with ChatGPT or Claude. You type a message. You hit enter. The system processes your request. It responds with text. You read it, type another message, and the cycle continues.

**Text in. Text out. Turn-based conversation.**

That's exactly what a terminal is.

## Look at the Animation

What you're seeing is **Claude Code** - an AI assistant that runs in a terminal. You type a request in plain English. It responds, runs commands, and shows you results.

This isn't a special interface. It's not a website. It's not an app with buttons and menus.

**It's a terminal.**

And you already understand how it works - because you've been having text conversations with AI for years.

## The Insight

The intimidation around terminals comes from thinking they're something foreign, something technical, something for programmers.

But you've been using the same interaction pattern every time you chat with AI:

- You type something
- You press enter
- You get a response
- You continue the conversation

**The terminal was the original chat interface.**
