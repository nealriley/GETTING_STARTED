Imagine standing in front of a vending machine. You want chips. You punch in random numbers. Gum falls out. You punch more random numbers. A granola bar. More numbers. Mints.

**You're pressing buttons. Just not the right ones.**

This is what working with AI looks like without proper context.

## Context Has Types

"Give it more context" is advice you'll hear constantly. But the right *kind* of context matters more than the amount.

**Domain Context** - What specialized knowledge does this task require?

Your industry terminology, your company's products, your field's conventions. This is knowledge AI needs but doesn't have.

**Procedural Context** - How should this be done?

Your workflows. Your processes. The steps you follow. The order things happen.

**Constraint Context** - What are the boundaries?

What NOT to do is often more important than what to do. Length limits. Forbidden topics. Required elements.

**Preference Context** - How should it feel?

Tone. Voice. Style. Format. Level of formality.

## The Anti-Pattern

The instinct is to throw everything at AI - every document, every piece of background - hoping the model will sort it out.

This rarely works. **Curated context beats comprehensive context.**

Three relevant paragraphs outperform thirty pages of "might be useful."

The vending machine is full of exactly what you want. You just have to press the right buttons.
