Every major AI provider offers two ways to access their models: a chat interface in your browser, and command-line tools for your terminal.

Same models. Same APIs. **Different capabilities.**

Chat interfaces are sandboxed. Text goes in, text comes out. The browser can't see your files, run commands, or touch anything on your system.


CLI tools run on your machine. They can read your files, send relevant context to the API, and act on the response—writing files, running commands, making changes directly.

Same intelligence. Different access.
