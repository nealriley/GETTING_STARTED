Every major AI provider offers two ways to access their models: a chat interface in your browser, and command-line tools for your terminal.

Same models. Same APIs. **Different capabilities.**

## Where You Use AI Tools Matters

Chat interfaces are sandboxed. Text goes in, text comes out. The browser can't see your files, run commands, or touch anything on your system.

CLI tools run on your machine. They can read your files, send relevant context to the API, and act on the response—writing files, running commands, making changes directly.

Same intelligence. Different access.

## Why Choose the Terminal?

The terminal connects AI to your local environment. That connection unlocks capabilities the chat interface can't match:

**Context from your actual files.** Instead of describing your project, the AI reads it directly—your documents, your data, your folder structure.

**Output you can immediately use.** The AI writes files to your machine. A report, a script, a config file—created and ready to use.

**Workflows that build on each other.** Read a file, transform it, save the result. Chained steps that would be tedious by hand.

The rest of this guide explores how to work in this environment—how terminals operate, how to provide useful context, and how to structure requests so the output is what you actually need.
