The App Store launched in 2008. But app stores have existed since the 1990s.

They just looked different. No icons. No "Buy" buttons. No star ratings. Just text - lists of software you could install with a single command, maintained by communities of developers who shared their work freely.

These are **package managers**. And they're still the primary way most software gets distributed.

## The Landscape

**Homebrew** (macOS and Linux) - The general-purpose app store for Mac users. Thousands of tools. One command to install anything.

**npm** (JavaScript ecosystem) - The world's largest software registry. Over two million packages.

**pip** (Python ecosystem) - The gateway to data science, automation, and machine learning.

## Why This Matters for AI

When an AI tool says "install ripgrep" or "you'll need to pip install this," it's pointing you to one of these ecosystems.

- Need to search through thousands of files instantly? **There's a package for that.**
- Need to convert a video format? **There's a package for that.**
- Need to process a spreadsheet programmatically? **There's a package for that.**

The AI isn't asking you to become a developer. It's pointing you to a tool that someone already built, tested, and shared - for free.

## The Trust Model

Open source means the code is public. Anyone can inspect it, audit it, improve it. When a package has been downloaded millions of times and maintained for years, you're trusting a community of people who use the same tool.

**You don't need to master these. You just need to know they exist.**
