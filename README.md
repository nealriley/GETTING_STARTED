## Key Documents

### PROJECT_BRIEF.md
Comprehensive project overview including:
- Target audience definition
- Core messaging and concepts
- Content strategy (static guide + animated companion)
- Success metrics and timeline
- Technical implementation notes

### content/FULL_GUIDE.md
Complete ~5,000 word markdown guide covering:
1. Interface landscape (Claude, Cowork, Gemini 3, Opus 4.5)
2. Terminal demystification and package managers
3. "More than code" use cases
4. Markdown as working memory
5. Structure and context principles
6. Prompt decoration techniques
7. "The factory is the teacher" philosophy

### animation/STORYBOARD.md
Scene-by-scene breakdown of 5-7 minute xterm.js animation:
- 10 scenes with timing and visuals
- Typewriter effects and ASCII art
- Interactive controls and accessibility
- Technical implementation specifications
- Deployment strategy

## Quick Start

**To read the full guide:**
```bash
cat content/FULL_GUIDE.md
```

**To review the animation storyboard:**
```bash
cat animation/STORYBOARD.md
```

**To understand the project strategy:**
```bash
cat PROJECT_BRIEF.md
```

## Content Principles

1. **Empathetic, not condescending** - Never call out intimidation, just treat concepts as matter-of-fact
2. **Show, don't just tell** - Concrete examples over abstractions
3. **Playful but precise** - Memorable metaphors without sacrificing accuracy
4. **Structure as content** - The guide itself demonstrates good documentation

## Target Audience

**Primary:** "The Technical Adjacent"
- UX researchers, product managers, designers, data analysts
- Work WITH technical systems daily
- Hear terms like "CLI," "MCPs," "prompt engineering" but don't use them
- Gap between knowing WHAT and knowing HOW

## Current Status

- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete:** Core content written, storyboard created, brief defined
- 🔲 **Phase 2:** Build xterm.js animation
- 🔲 **Phase 3:** Polish and accessibility
- 🔲 **Phase 4:** Launch and distribution
- 🔲 **Phase 5:** Iteration and community feedback

## Next Steps

See PROJECT_BRIEF.md "Open Questions" section for decisions to make before implementation.
