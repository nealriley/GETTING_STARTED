# Section 10: Context Is King

## Animation: `10-ContextAnimation`

Vending machine metaphor - four context types (Domain, Procedural, Constraint, Preference).

## Design Notes

**Concept: "The Right Buttons"**

The vending machine metaphor: you're pressing buttons, just not the right ones. Context has types.

**Duration:** ~25 seconds

### Visual Breakdown

1. **The Vending Machine** - AI as a vending machine full of capabilities
2. **Random Pressing** - User presses random buttons, wrong outputs fall out
3. **The Four Buttons** - Domain, Procedural, Constraint, Preference revealed
4. **Right Buttons** - User presses correct combination
5. **Perfect Output** - Exactly what was wanted emerges
6. **The Anti-Pattern** - "Throwing everything at AI" visualization (overwhelming)
7. **The Insight** - "Curated context beats comprehensive context"

**Key Visual:** Four distinct buttons/panels representing each context type

**Context Types:**
- **Domain** - Specialized knowledge, terminology, conventions
- **Procedural** - Workflows, processes, steps
- **Constraint** - Boundaries, limits, what NOT to do
- **Preference** - Tone, voice, style, format

## Content Summary

Introduces the concept that context has types, and providing the right TYPE of context matters more than the amount. Three relevant paragraphs outperform thirty pages of "might be useful."
