# Section 7: More Than Just Code

## Animation: `07-CreationAnimation`

Terminals create more than code - documents, images, visualizations, audio, scripts.

## Design Notes

**Concept: "The Creation Machine"**

Shatter the assumption that terminals are for code by showing the full spectrum of what they can create.

**Duration:** ~20 seconds

### Visual Breakdown

1. **The Assumption** - Terminal = Code (crossed out)
2. **Documents** - Reports, PDFs, formatted documentation flowing out
3. **Images** - Graphics, processed photos, diagrams
4. **Visualizations** - Charts, graphs, dashboards
5. **Audio** - Transcriptions, processed audio, text-to-speech
6. **Scripts** - Automation, batch operations, file management
7. **The Reframe** - "Not a coding tool. A creation tool with a text interface."

**Key Insight:** The question isn't "can I code?" but "what do I want to create?"

**Visual Hook:** Multiple creation types cascading from a single terminal window

## Content Summary
