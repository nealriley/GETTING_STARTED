# Section 4: Same Pattern, Different Words

## Animation: `04-RawTerminalAnimation`

Raw terminal commands showing the same text-in/text-out pattern.

## Design Notes

**Concept:** Show the same action (listing files) in raw terminal commands vs natural language, emphasizing that only the vocabulary differs.

**Duration:** ~15 seconds

### Visual Breakdown

1. **Terminal with command** - User types `ls`
2. **Result appears** - File listing output
3. **Comparison** - "List the files" (natural language) = `ls` (command)
4. **The Pattern** - Same text in → text out → continue cycle

**Key Insight:** Terminal commands are just a foreign vocabulary, not a different interaction model.

**Visual Hook:** The same file listing appearing from both natural language and `ls` command

## Content Summary

Demystifies terminal commands by showing they're abbreviations (ls=list, cd=change directory, etc.) following the same interaction pattern users already know from chat.
