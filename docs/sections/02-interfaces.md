# Section 2: Not All Models Are the Same, Not All Interfaces Either

## Animation: `02-InterfacesAnimation`

Same AI orb displayed in different interface containers.

## Design Notes

**Concept: "Same Brain, Different Body"**

Visualize the same AI model being accessed through different interfaces, showing how the experience changes while the underlying intelligence stays constant.

**Duration:** ~25 seconds

### Visual Breakdown

1. **The Core** - Abstract glowing orb representing "the model"
2. **Web Chat** - Orb contained in a browser window (limited access)
3. **CLI Tool** - Orb in terminal with file system access (can reach out)
4. **Desktop App** - Orb in GUI window with folder access (approachable + powerful)
5. **The Reveal** - Split screen showing all interfaces with identical orb

**Key Moment:** The visual reveals that the same intelligence exists in each interface, but capabilities differ based on access.

**Visual Hook:** The "orb" that represents the model, dressed in different interface "bodies"

## Content Summary

Explores how the same AI model can be accessed through web chat, CLI tools, desktop apps, and embedded integrations - each with different capabilities. The interface determines what's possible.
