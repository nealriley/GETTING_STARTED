# Section 3: You Already Know This

## Animation: `03-ClaudeChatAnimation`

Subtractive flow showing same prompt traveling from web chat to terminal.

## Design Notes

**Concept: "You Already Know This"**

Demystify the terminal by showing that it's the same interaction pattern as web chat. The prompt "travels" between windows to reinforce that it's the same action in both places.

**Duration:** ~18 seconds

### Scene Flow

**Scene 1: Web Browser** (~8s)
- ChatGPT-style browser with sidebar, chat area, input box
- User asks: "What are three tips for better presentations?"
- AI responds with three tips
- Familiar, comfortable interface

**Transition: Prompt Travels** (~2s)
- Web fades
- The user's prompt floats to center
- Moves toward terminal as it fades in
- Prompt "lands" in the terminal

**Scene 2: Terminal** (~5s)
- Same prompt appears
- Subtle: `→ Reading ./notes/presentations.md` (hints at local context)
- Same three tips appear
- Same pattern, different wrapper

**Scene 3: Insight** (~3s)
- "Text in. Text out."
- "You already know this."

### Visual Elements

**Web Browser:**
- Full browser chrome (dots, nav buttons, URL bar)
- ChatGPT-style layout (sidebar with history, main chat area)
- OpenAI green avatar for AI
- Blue bubble for user message

**Terminal:**
- Consistent with Sections 1-2
- Green prompt, response with left border
- Context line shows local file reading (subtle)

### The Traveling Prompt

The user's question physically moves from the web interface to the terminal. This visual metaphor reinforces:
1. It's the same question
2. It's the same action (type and send)
3. The only difference is where you're typing

### Key Message

You've been using this interaction pattern for years with AI chatbots. The terminal is just another place to have the same conversation—but with access to your local environment.
