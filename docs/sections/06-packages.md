# Section 6: The Original App Stores

## Animation: `06-PackageManagerAnimation`

Package managers across different platforms (Homebrew, npm, pip).

## Design Notes

**Concept:** Package managers are app stores that predate mobile app stores by decades.

**Duration:** ~20 seconds

### Visual Breakdown

1. **The Comparison** - Mobile App Store icon transforms into terminal
2. **Homebrew** - macOS package manager with example install
3. **npm** - JavaScript ecosystem ("world's largest software registry")
4. **pip** - Python ecosystem (gateway to data science)
5. **The Pattern** - One command installs anything

**Key Insight:** When AI says "install ripgrep" or "pip install this," it's pointing to free, community-maintained software.

**Visual Hook:** The familiar app store grid transforming into terminal package listings
