# Getting Started Project - Changelog

## 2026-01-14: Project Foundation

### Created
- Complete project structure and organization
- PROJECT_BRIEF.md with comprehensive strategy
- content/FULL_GUIDE.md (~5,000 words, complete draft)
- animation/STORYBOARD.md (10 scenes, ~7 min experience)
- Archive of initial materials

### Interview Process
- Conducted conversational interview to understand target audience
- Key insight: Christmas lunch conversation with UX researcher about CLI concepts
- Identified "technical adjacent" as primary persona
- Explored metaphors: chef/kitchen, vending machine, factory as teacher

### Content Development
- Started with original outline skeleton
- Expanded through Q&A interview format
- Developed 8 major sections with examples and analogies
- Added meta-commentary ("Why this is called 'Getting Started'")
- Emphasis on empathetic tone without being condescending

### Animation Storyboard
- Designed 10-scene xterm.js experience
- Incorporated ASCII art, typewriter effects, interactive controls
- Balanced entertainment with education
- Technical specs for implementation
- Accessibility considerations built-in from start

### Key Decisions Made
- **Format:** Hybrid approach (static guide primary + animated companion)
- **Length:** Full guide ~5,000 words, animation 5-7 minutes
- **Tone:** Playful but precise, empathetic not condescending
- **Structure:** Modular content for easy remixing

### Key Metaphors Established
- **Chef/Kitchen:** You don't need to be a professional chef to cook dinner
- **Vending Machine:** Press the right buttons, for gods sake
- **Factory as Teacher:** Means of production (documentation) has become a sage
- **Mechanical Rubber Duck:** AI as conversational thinking partner

### Open Questions (for next phase)
- Project naming beyond "Getting Started"?
- Voice/narrator (first person vs second person)?
- Licensing model (CC-BY? MIT?)?
- Maintenance ownership as tools evolve?
- Monetization strategy (free forever? donations?)?
