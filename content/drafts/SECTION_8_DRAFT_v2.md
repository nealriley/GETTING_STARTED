# Section 8: Context Is King

---

Imagine standing in front of a vending machine. You want chips. You punch in random numbers. Gum falls out. You punch more random numbers. A granola bar. More numbers. Mints.

You're pressing buttons. Just not the right ones.

This is what working with AI looks like without proper context. The machine is capable. You're just not telling it what you actually want.

## Context Has Types

"Give it more context" is advice you'll hear constantly. But more isn't always better. The right *kind* of context matters more than the amount.

Think of context as falling into a few categories:

**Domain Context** - What specialized knowledge does this task require?

You're an expert in something. AI isn't - at least not in the specific way you are. Your industry terminology, your company's products, your field's conventions, your audience's expectations. This is knowledge AI needs but doesn't have.

If you're a UX researcher asking for help analyzing user interviews, the AI needs to know your research methodology, your project goals, what "good" looks like in your context.

**Procedural Context** - How should this be done?

Your workflows. Your processes. The steps you follow. The order things happen.

When you ask AI to "help with a report," it doesn't know your report process. Does it start with an outline? Does it need executive summary first? Is there a template you follow? Procedural context fills these gaps.

**Constraint Context** - What are the boundaries?

What NOT to do is often more important than what to do. Length limits. Forbidden topics. Required elements. Deadlines. Approval processes. Legal requirements.

AI will happily generate something beautiful and completely unusable if you don't tell it the constraints. This is the context most people forget.

**Preference Context** - How should it feel?

Tone. Voice. Style. Format. Level of formality. Use of humor. Technical depth.

Two correct answers can feel completely different. Preference context is what makes the output feel like *yours* rather than generic.

## The Anti-Pattern

The instinct is to throw everything at AI - every document, every piece of background, every detail you can think of - hoping the model will sort it out.

This rarely works.

More context with poor signal-to-noise ratio makes AI's job harder, not easier. It has to figure out what's relevant before it can even start on your actual request.

Curated context beats comprehensive context. Three relevant paragraphs outperform thirty pages of "might be useful."

## The Right Buttons

When you get garbage output, ask yourself:

- Did I provide domain context? (What does AI need to know about my field?)
- Did I provide procedural context? (How should this be done?)
- Did I provide constraint context? (What are the limits and rules?)
- Did I provide preference context? (How should it sound?)

You don't need all four every time. But knowing they exist helps you diagnose what's missing.

The vending machine is full of exactly what you want. You just have to press the right buttons.

**Word count:** ~480
**Tone:** Practical, diagnostic
**Key insight:** Context types matter more than context volume
**Metaphor:** Vending machine (buttons, not coins)
