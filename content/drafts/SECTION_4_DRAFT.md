# Section 4: The Original App Stores

---

The App Store launched in 2008. But app stores have existed since the 1990s.

They just looked different. No icons. No "Buy" buttons. No star ratings. Just text - lists of software you could install with a single command, maintained by communities of developers who shared their work freely.

These are package managers. And they're still the primary way most software gets distributed.

## The Landscape

**Homebrew** (macOS and Linux)
The general-purpose app store for Mac users. Thousands of tools - from simple utilities to complex applications. One command to install anything.

**apt** and **yum** (Linux)
Built into Linux systems. How servers install and update everything. If you've ever used a website, you've used software installed through these.

**npm** (JavaScript ecosystem)
The world's largest software registry. Over two million packages. If it runs in a browser or on a server, there's probably an npm package for it.

**pip** (Python ecosystem)
The gateway to data science, automation, and machine learning. Every major AI library lives here.

## Why This Matters for AI

When an AI tool says "install ripgrep" or "you'll need to pip install this," it's pointing you to one of these ecosystems. It assumes you have access because these tools make complex tasks trivial.

Need to search through thousands of files instantly? There's a package for that.
Need to convert a video format? There's a package for that.
Need to process a spreadsheet programmatically? There's a package for that.

The AI isn't asking you to become a developer. It's pointing you to a tool that someone already built, tested, and shared - for free.

## The Trust Model

Here's something the commercial app stores can't offer: you can see exactly how these tools work.

Open source means the code is public. Anyone can inspect it, audit it, improve it. When a package has been downloaded millions of times and maintained for years, you're not trusting a faceless corporation. You're trusting a community of people who use the same tool and have every incentive to keep it secure.

This transparency is why AI tools default to recommending open-source packages. They're documented. They're battle-tested. They're understood.

## You Don't Need to Master These

You don't need to memorize commands or understand package management deeply. You just need to know these ecosystems exist.

When AI suggests installing something, you'll understand what it's asking. When documentation mentions "brew install" or "pip install," you'll recognize the pattern. When you see a tool that could help your workflow, you'll know where to find it.

The original app stores have been here all along. Now you know where to look.
