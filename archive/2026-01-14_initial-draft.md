# Initial Draft - January 14, 2026

## Original Outline (Before Expansion)

# GETTING_STARTED.md

Throughout my career, a passion of mine has always been helping people who do not necessarily come from a technical background or training, who want to learn how to "code". 

The recent tidal wave of new 'vibe coders' - has raised furrowed brows from those trained in the art of software development. Rightly so, the process of building production-grade, industrial strength software is by no means an easy task. 

However, you do not need to be a professional chef to know how to cook your own dinner, but you need to know what kinds of dangers exist in a kitchen. 

These AI models, platforms, and products can act as a bridge, helping those without the training or skill to be able to leap ahead and make use of technology that would previously be out of reach. 

When you have a little knowledge under your belt, this gap narrows even more. This allows you to make use of some powerful tools with relative ease, while also rapidly gaining hands on experience with some of the more complex software development skills. 

Working with people across a wide range of skill levels, I've come up with a basic rubric to get started. These guiding principles should help you adopting all kinds of AI tools, make use of some of the more complex software concepts, and begin generating all kinds of interesting content, code, and more! 


Not all models are the same, not all interfaces either.

- Claude Cowork
- CLIs
- 3rd party CLIs
- in-product AI
 tools

The tools of the -vibe- coding trade

- Terminal goodies
- Open source software ecosystems (package managers, distribution) 

More than just code

- Manipulating files
- Using cli tools for complex* problems
- CLI tools and multi-modality (images) 

The incredible usefulness of Markdown

- Definitions and Documentation
- Short term 'memory'
- Task lists and 'peristence' 

A little bit of structure goes a long way

- Applies to all AI interfaces
- Breaking down a problem space

Context is king

- These AI tools jump significantly in quality when paired with quality context
- Relevant, contextual content that aids in the process of generating good output

Decorating your prompts

- Models can tune for certain decorators
- XML and its uses 
- Building your own

The factory is the teacher

## Notes on Original Draft

- Started as bullet-point outline/skeleton
- Strong opening philosophy (chef metaphor established early)
- Good intuition on topics but minimal detail
- "The factory is the teacher" was intriguing but unexplained
- Typo: "peristence" → "persistence"
- Formatting issue: "in-product AI\n tools" (line break mid-phrase)

## What Was Missing

- **Target audience clarity**: Who specifically is this for?
- **Concrete examples**: Outline needed flesh on bones
- **Recent context**: Cowork, Gemini 3, Opus 4.5 developments
- **Deeper explanations**: Each section was a header without substance
- **Connections between concepts**: How topics relate to each other
- **Practical guidance**: What should readers actually DO?

## Interview Process Outcomes

Through conversational interview, we:
1. Defined "technical adjacent" persona (UX researcher at Christmas lunch)
2. Expanded each section with examples and analogies
3. Added historical context (stepping backward to leap forward)
4. Developed metaphors (vending machine, factory walls)
5. Connected concepts (file access → structured content → everything)
6. Added meta-commentary about documentation itself

## Transformation Summary

- **Before**: ~500 words of outline
- **After**: ~5,000 words of comprehensive guide
- **Expansion**: 10x growth through interview-driven development
- **Structure**: From bullets to narrative to actionable guidance
