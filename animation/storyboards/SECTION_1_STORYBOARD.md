# Section 1: For the Technical Adjacent
## Animation Assessment

**Recommendation: NO STANDALONE ANIMATION**

This section is the written introduction - it sets context for who the guide is for and what they'll learn. The content is meta (about the guide itself) rather than conceptual.

**Reasoning:**
- The section is primarily orientation, not insight
- The "chef/kitchen" metaphor could be visualized, but it's a brief analogy, not a sustained concept
- Better to let this content live in the written guide and save animation time for sections with higher visual teaching potential

**Alternative consideration:**
If we create an overall "series intro" animation, elements from Section 1 (the gap narrowing, the technical adjacent persona) could be woven into that opening. But it doesn't warrant its own piece.

**Decision: Skip standalone animation for Section 1**
