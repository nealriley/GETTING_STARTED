# Section 5: More Than Just Code
## Animation Storyboards

**Recommendation: ONE ANIMATION (Option A preferred)**

---

## Option A: "The Creation Machine"

**Concept:** Directly confront and shatter the "terminals = code" assumption by showing a rapid cascade of non-code creations flowing from the same interface.

**Duration:** 60-75 seconds

### Scene Breakdown

**Scene 1: The Assumption (10 seconds)**
```
Visual: Terminal window. Code scrolling. Brackets, semicolons, 
function definitions.

Text overlay: "You think this is for code."

More code. Programming. Developer stuff.

Text: "You're wrong."
```

**Scene 2: The Pivot (5 seconds)**
```
Visual: The code STOPS. Screen clears.

New prompt appears: $ _

Text: "Watch what else it makes."
```

**Scene 3: Documents (10 seconds)**
```
Visual: Command typed: "Create quarterly report from these notes"

The terminal processes. Then a PDF materializes - formatted, 
professional, with headers and charts.

Another command: "Convert to presentation"

Slides appear. Same content, new format.

Text flash: "DOCUMENTS"
```

**Scene 4: Images (10 seconds)**
```
Visual: Command: "Process product photos for web"

200 images flow through the terminal. They emerge resized, 
compressed, watermarked.

Command: "Generate diagram of user flow"

A flowchart draws itself.

Text flash: "IMAGES"
```

**Scene 5: Visualizations (10 seconds)**
```
Visual: Command: "Visualize sales data"

A CSV scrolls past. Then charts BLOOM - bar graphs, line charts, 
a dashboard assembling itself.

Command: "Make it interactive"

The static charts become clickable, zoomable.

Text flash: "VISUALIZATIONS"
```

**Scene 6: Audio (10 seconds)**
```
Visual: Command: "Transcribe meeting recording"

Audio waveform appears. Text streams out - timestamped transcript.

Command: "Clean up podcast audio"

Waveform transforms - noise disappears, levels normalize.

Text flash: "AUDIO"
```

**Scene 7: Automation (10 seconds)**
```
Visual: Command: "Every night, back up my project folders"

A script writes itself. A clock appears - midnight. Folders 
copy themselves.

Command: "When new files appear, process them"

A watcher activates. Files arrive, get processed, sorted.

Text flash: "AUTOMATION"
```

**Scene 8: The Reveal (10 seconds)**
```
Visual: All the outputs float around the terminal - documents, 
images, visualizations, audio files, running automations.

The terminal is at the center. It made ALL of these.

Text: "Not a coding tool."

Beat.

Text: "A creation tool."

Beat.

Text: "What do you want to make?"
```

---

## Option B: "The Wrong Question"

**Concept:** Frame it as answering the wrong question - people ask "can I code?" when they should ask "what can I create?"

**Duration:** 45-60 seconds

### Scene Breakdown

**Scene 1: The Wrong Question (10 seconds)**
```
Visual: Text typing on screen, as if someone is searching:

"Do I need to learn to code?"
"Is coding hard?"
"Can non-programmers use terminal?"

Each question appears and fades.

Text overlay: "Wrong question."
```

**Scene 2: The Right Question (5 seconds)**
```
Visual: All questions clear.

New text, larger: "What do you want to CREATE?"
```

**Scene 3: The Answers (30 seconds)**
```
Visual: A rapid montage. For each, a brief creation:

"Reports" → PDF materializes
"Images" → Photos process and transform
"Charts" → Visualizations bloom
"Audio" → Waveforms clean up
"Workflows" → Automation runs

Each emerges from the same source: a terminal prompt.

The creations orbit the terminal, a constellation of outputs.
```

**Scene 4: The Reframe (10 seconds)**
```
Visual: The constellation settles.

Text: "The terminal doesn't care if you're a developer."

Beat.

Text: "It just executes."

The terminal cursor blinks, waiting.

Text: "What do you want to make?"
```

## Recommendation

**Option A ("The Creation Machine")** is stronger because:
- The sequential reveals build momentum
- Each category gets its moment (documents, images, etc.)
- The cascade of creation is visually exciting
- The ending reframe ("creation tool, not coding tool") lands hard after proof

Option B is tighter but less memorable - it tells rather than shows.

**Decision: One animation, Option A preferred**
