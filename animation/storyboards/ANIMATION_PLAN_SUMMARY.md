## The Pieces

### 1. "Same Brain, Different Body" (Section 2)
**Concept:** Same AI model accessed through different interfaces, showing how capability changes.
**Visual hook:** The "orb" that represents the model, dressed in different interface "bodies"
**Key moment:** Split-screen reveal showing all interfaces with the same orb

### 2. "You Already Know This" (Sections 3+4 Combined)
**Concept:** Two revelations - terminal=chat, package managers=app stores
**Visual hook:** The parallel comparisons; the timeline reveal
**Key moment:** "You already knew this. Now you know you knew."
**Why combined:** Both sections share the theme of demystifying through familiar comparisons

### 3. "The Creation Machine" (Section 5)
**Concept:** Shatter the "terminals=code" assumption with a cascade of non-code creations
**Visual hook:** Documents, images, visualizations, audio flowing from the same terminal
**Key moment:** "Not a coding tool. A creation tool."

### 4. "Description Becomes Reality" (Section 6)
**Concept:** The magic of markdown - describe something, it becomes real
**Visual hook:** The three layers stacking; the evolution time-lapse
**Key moment:** The file SAVES, then the AI uses it - description activating

### 5. "The Transformation" (Section 7)
**Concept:** Watch messy input restructure itself, then see AI's response quality transform
**Visual hook:** Text reorganizing itself from chaos to structure
**Key moment:** Side-by-side comparison of garbage input→garbage output vs structured input→perfect output
**Principle:** "Weave don't state" - never SAY structure helps, SHOW it

### 6. "The Right Buttons" (Section 8)
**Concept:** The vending machine metaphor - context has types, press the right ones
**Visual hook:** The four-button panel (Domain, Procedural, Constraint, Preference)
**Key moment:** Random button pressing → wrong outputs; right buttons → perfect output

### 7. "The Story in Structure" (Section 9) - THE SPECIAL ONE
**Concept:** Tell ONE story by moving through different structural formats
**Visual hook:** The content stays constant while XML→JavaScript→JSON→HTML→Markdown
**Key moment:** All five formats shown together, same story in each
**Why special:** The format IS the medium; the animation IS the teaching

### 8. "The Walls Come Alive" (Section 10)
**Concept:** Documentation as factory walls that used to be passive, now productive
**Visual hook:** Static text on walls GLOWING as AI touches and uses it
**Key moment:** "Documentation used to teach. Now it works."

## Series Closing (Optional)

If compiling all animations into a series, use **"The Gap Has Narrowed"** as a final closing:
- Brief flashes of each section's core visual
- The gap from Section 1 shrinking with each flash
- Ends with: "The tools are ready. What will you build?"

## Production Notes

### Visual Continuity
- The "orb" from Section 2 could reappear in other sections (10 especially)
- Terminal aesthetic should be consistent across 3, 4, 5
- Text styling should match the guide's markdown aesthetic

### Pacing
- Sections 3+4 combined (longest at ~2 min)
- Section 9 is pacing-critical (format transitions need rhythm)
- Section 10 should breathe - reflective, not rushed

### Key Principles
- Show, don't tell (especially Section 7)
- The format IS the message (especially Section 9)
- Satisfy the "aha moment" (especially 3+4 reveal)

## Next Steps

1. Review storyboards and select final approaches
2. Decide on visual style (illustration, motion graphics, mixed)
3. Identify any storyboards needing revision
4. Begin production on highest-priority pieces
5. Consider series compilation vs. standalone releases
