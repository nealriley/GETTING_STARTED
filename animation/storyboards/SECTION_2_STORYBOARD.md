# Section 2: Not All Models Are the Same, Not All Interfaces Either
## Animation Storyboards

**Recommendation: ONE ANIMATION (Option A preferred)**

---

## Option A: "Same Brain, Different Body"

**Concept:** Visualize the same AI model being accessed through radically different interfaces, showing how the experience changes while the underlying intelligence stays constant.

**Duration:** 60-90 seconds

### Scene Breakdown

**Scene 1: The Core (5 seconds)**
```
Visual: Abstract representation of "the model" - a glowing orb, 
neural pattern, or similar. Pulsing, alive, consistent.

Text overlay: "The model"
```

**Scene 2: Web Chat (15 seconds)**
```
Visual: The orb drops into a browser window. Clean chat interface 
materializes around it. User types "analyze my project files"

The interface shows a polite response: "I don't have access to 
your files. Could you paste the content here?"

Visual cue: The orb is the same, but it's... contained. Limited.
```

**Scene 3: CLI Tool (15 seconds)**
```
Visual: Same orb, now drops into a terminal window. Black screen, 
blinking cursor.

User types same request. The terminal explodes with activity - 
file trees appearing, code scrolling, the orb now reaching OUT 
into the filesystem.

Text: "Found 47 files. Analyzing..."

Visual cue: Same orb, but now it has arms. It can touch things.
```

**Scene 4: Desktop App (15 seconds)**
```
Visual: Same orb, now in a friendly GUI window. Folder icon 
visible. The interface is approachable - buttons, panels.

User drags a folder. The orb reads it. No terminal visible, 
but the same reaching-out capability.

Visual cue: Same orb, same reach, different clothes.
```

**Scene 5: The Reveal (15 seconds)**
```
Visual: Split screen showing all three interfaces side by side. 
The orb is identical in each. But the "body" around it is different.

Text builds:
"Same intelligence"
"Different access"
"The interface IS the experience"
```

**Scene 6: Close (10 seconds)**
```
Visual: The orbs merge back into one.

Text: "Choose the right tool for the task."

The single orb splits again into multiple interface shapes, 
each flying off to do different work.
```

## Option B: "The Landscape Tour"

**Concept:** A rapid flythrough of the interface landscape, giving viewers a mental map of what exists without deep-diving into any single one.

**Duration:** 45-60 seconds

### Scene Breakdown

**Scene 1: The Question (5 seconds)**
```
Text on black: "Which AI should I use?"

Beat.

Text changes: "Wrong question."
```

**Scene 2: The Real Question (5 seconds)**
```
Text: "Which INTERFACE should I use?"

Visual: A landscape begins to form - terrain, regions, zones.
```

**Scene 3: The Tour (30 seconds)**
```
Camera flies through the landscape. Each region is an interface type:

REGION 1: "Web Chat" - rolling hills, accessible, everyone starts here
- claude.ai, chatgpt.com floating as signposts
- Visual: Pleasant but... flat. Can't go underground.

REGION 2: "CLI Tools" - a canyon or underground area, deeper access
- Claude Code, terminals as cave entrances
- Visual: Less pretty, but you can DIG. Access to roots.

REGION 3: "Desktop Apps" - a city or structured area
- Cowork, Cursor, Windsurf as buildings
- Visual: Best of both - structure AND depth

REGION 4: "Embedded" - tools scattered throughout
- Copilot, Excel integrations as tools in the landscape
- Visual: Everywhere, but context-limited

Camera pulls back to show the whole map.
```

**Scene 4: The Insight (10 seconds)**
```
Visual: The same "model orb" from Option A appears, hovering 
over the entire landscape.

Text: "Same model. Different interfaces. Different possibilities."

The orb descends into different regions, showing it can exist 
in any of them.
```

**Scene 5: Close (5 seconds)**
```
Text: "Pick the right region for the job."

The map fades, leaving just the question: "What do you need to do?"
```

---

## Recommendation

**Option A ("Same Brain, Different Body")** is stronger because:
- It makes ONE clear point memorably (interface determines capability)
- The "orb" visual creates continuity
- It's more focused than a landscape tour
- The split-screen reveal is a strong ending

Option B covers more ground but risks being a list rather than an insight.

**Decision: One animation, Option A preferred**
