# Section 8: Context Is King
## Animation Storyboards

**Recommendation: ONE ANIMATION (Option A preferred)**

The vending machine metaphor is strong and visual. The four context types need clear, memorable presentation.

---

## Option A: "The Right Buttons"

**Concept:** The vending machine metaphor, fully realized. Show someone pressing wrong buttons (getting garbage), then learning which buttons actually matter.

**Duration:** 75-90 seconds

### Scene Breakdown

**Scene 1: The Machine (10 seconds)**
```
Visual: A vending machine. But instead of snacks, it's full 
of AI outputs - documents, analyses, code, summaries.

Everything you could want is IN there. Visible through the glass.

A user approaches. They want... a Q3 analysis report.
```

**Scene 2: Random Buttons (15 seconds)**
```
Visual: The user starts pressing buttons randomly.

A7 → Generic blog post falls out. Not what they wanted.
B3 → Bullet points about something unrelated.
C9 → A hallucinated analysis with wrong numbers.

Each output lands with a THUD. Wrong. Useless.

Text: "You're pressing buttons."

Beat.

Text: "Just not the RIGHT buttons."
```

**Scene 3: The Control Panel (10 seconds)**
```
Visual: Camera pulls back. The vending machine has a control 
panel with four distinct sections:

[DOMAIN]  [PROCEDURAL]  [CONSTRAINT]  [PREFERENCE]

These are the actual buttons that matter.

Text: "Context has types."
```

**Scene 4: The Four Types (30 seconds)**
```
Visual: Each section lights up as it's explained:

DOMAIN (10 sec)
"What specialized knowledge is needed?"
Example: "UX research methodology, our product, our users"
User presses this section → The machine UNDERSTANDS the field.

PROCEDURAL (8 sec)
"How should this be done?"  
Example: "Start with summary, then details, use our template"
User presses → The machine knows the PROCESS.

CONSTRAINT (7 sec)
"What are the limits?"
Example: "Under 500 words, no jargon, must cite sources"
User presses → The machine knows the BOUNDARIES.

PREFERENCE (5 sec)
"How should it feel?"
Example: "Formal but warm, confident, executive audience"
User presses → The machine knows the STYLE.
```

**Scene 5: The Right Request (10 seconds)**
```
Visual: User has pressed all four button types.

They reach for the main keypad. Type in their request:
"Generate Q3 analysis report"

The machine WHIRS. It knows:
- The domain (their business, their metrics)
- The procedure (their report format)
- The constraints (length, audience)
- The preference (their voice)
```

**Scene 6: The Perfect Output (10 seconds)**
```
Visual: The EXACT right document falls out.

Formatted correctly. Right length. Right tone. Right content.

The user takes it. Perfect fit.

Text: "Same machine."

Beat.

Text: "Right buttons."
```

**Scene 7: Close (5 seconds)**
```
Visual: The four-button panel glows.

Text: "Press the right buttons."
```

---

## Option B: "The Anti-Pattern"

**Concept:** Focus on what NOT to do - the context dump. Show how MORE context with poor signal-to-noise ratio makes things worse.

**Duration:** 45-60 seconds

### Scene Breakdown

**Scene 1: The Dump (15 seconds)**
```
Visual: Someone preparing to prompt AI.

They start attaching files. More files. More context.

The entire company wiki. Last year's reports. Random documents.
"Just in case it's helpful."

A MOUNTAIN of context builds up.
```

**Scene 2: The Overwhelm (15 seconds)**
```
Visual: The AI receives this mountain.

It starts processing. But it's DROWNING. Too much signal noise.

The output that emerges is... mediocre. Generic. It couldn't 
find the relevant parts among the noise.

Text: "More context isn't better context."
```

**Scene 3: The Curation (15 seconds)**
```
Visual: Same request. But this time:

Three relevant paragraphs. One example. Clear constraints.

Curated. Focused. Signal.

The AI processes FAST. The output is PRECISE.

Text: "Curated beats comprehensive."
```

**Scene 4: Close (10 seconds)**
```
Visual: Side by side.

LEFT: Mountain of context → Mediocre output
RIGHT: Curated context → Perfect output

Text: "Quality over quantity."
```

## Recommendation

**Option A ("The Right Buttons")** is stronger because:
- The vending machine metaphor is memorable and fun
- The four button types give viewers a mental framework
- It's actionable (now they know WHAT to provide)
- The payoff (perfect output) is satisfying

Option B makes an important point about context dumping, but it's more about avoiding a mistake than building capability.

---

**Decision: One animation, Option A preferred**

**Note:** The "anti-pattern" from Option B could be a brief 10-second opener for Option A - show the context dump failing, THEN reveal the four-button framework as the solution.
